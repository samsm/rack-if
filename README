Use or don't use rack apps based on a variety of environment variables.

gem install rackif --source http://gemcutter.org

Example:

require 'rackif'
use Rack::If, {:path => /\A\/protected.*/, :method => 'POST'}, :any do
  use Rack::Auth::Basic, "Rack::If Example" do |username, password|
    'secret' == password
  end
end

The third argument (:all or :any) is optional, defaults to :all.

With :all, all options must match for the block to get run. In the above example, the path would need to start with /protected AND the method would need to be POST. With :any, if ANY of the criteria match (either POST or the path), the block is run.

Options available are: path, method, user_agent, host, port, query_string, http_accept, and http_accept_encoding.

Values given can be strings or regex (=== used for comparison).
